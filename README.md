# Stack-Overflow-Community-Network-Analysis-with-Python

Introduction:
This project analyzes the temporal network structure of the Stack Overflow community, examining the patterns and properties of user interactions over time. By investigating the evolution of the community, the analysis aims to provide insights into the behavior and relationships of its members. The findings can be useful for developers, researchers, and community managers interested in building and managing online communities.

Data:
This project utilized the Stack Overflow interaction data obtained from the SNAP website of Stanford University (http://snap.stanford.edu/data/). The data contains three datasets, each representing different interaction types between users on the platform. The three datasets are:
i) A2Q = User V answered User U’s question
ii) C2A = User V commented on U’s answer
iii) C2Q = User V commented on U’s question

Preparing the Data:
Using these datasets, we constructed a temporal network of interactions between Stack Overflow users, where each interaction is associated with a specific time. As the datasets contain a vast amount of data, we filtered the interactions to consider only the ones that occurred in the year 2015 across all three datasets.

The resulting dataset contains four variables, namely:

Source: The user who initiated the interaction (User V)
Target: The user who received the interaction (User U)
Time: The timestamp of the interaction
Type: The type of interaction (a2q, c2a, c2q)

Exploratory Data Analysis:
The A2Q dataset contains 3,347 interactions, while the C2Q dataset is the densest with around 3.95 million interactions, and the C2A dataset contains 207k interactions. This dataset will serve as the basis for our exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and selection, network visualization, and temporal network analysis.
