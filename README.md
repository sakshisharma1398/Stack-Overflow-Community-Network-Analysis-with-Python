# Stack-Overflow-Community-Network-Analysis-with-Python

Introduction:
This project analyzes the temporal network structure of the Stack Overflow community, examining the patterns and properties of user interactions over time. By investigating the evolution of the community, the analysis aims to provide insights into the behavior and relationships of its members. The findings can be useful for developers, researchers, and community managers interested in building and managing online communities.

Data:
This project utilized the Stack Overflow interaction data obtained from the SNAP website of Stanford University (http://snap.stanford.edu/data/). The data contains three datasets, each representing different interaction types between users on the platform. The three datasets are:
i) A2Q = User V answered User U’s question
ii) C2A = User V commented on U’s answer
iii) C2Q = User V commented on U’s question

Preparing the Data:
Using these datasets, we constructed a temporal network of interactions between Stack Overflow users, where each interaction is associated with a specific time. As the datasets contain a vast amount of data, we filtered the interactions to consider only the ones that occurred in the year 2015 across all three datasets.

The resulting dataset contains four variables, namely:

Source: The user who initiated the interaction (User V)
Target: The user who received the interaction (User U)
Time: The timestamp of the interaction
Type: The type of interaction (a2q, c2a, c2q)

This dataset will serve as the basis for our exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and selection, network visualization, and temporal network analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
The A2Q dataset contains 3,070 interactions, while the C2Q dataset is the densest with around 3.95 million interactions, and the C2A dataset contains 191k interactions. 

Number of unique ID who asks questions - a2q: 1891,  
Number of unique ID who answers questions - a2q: 1723

Number of unique ID who asks questions - c2q: 531308,  
Number of unique ID who comment on questions - c2q: 431971

Number of unique ID who give answers - c2a: 29395, 
Number of unique ID who comment on answers - c2a: 44363

Data Visulization:
The visulization of the 3 interactions over the year 2015 shows that the C2Q interactions had the highest numbers, followed by C2A, and A2Q with the lowest count. The A2Q interactions showed a peak on Wednesdays, while the C2A and C2Q interactions had similar trends with the highest interaction numbers on Wednesdays and lowest on Sundays. 

Network Analysis: 
In order to create a network, a Python function is developed that creates a network graph using the NetworkX and Network packages. The function takes three parameters - a dataframe containing edge list data, a range value to subset the dataframe, and a name for the graph file. The function first subsets the dataframe, creates a NetworkX graph from the edge list data, calculates node degree, sets up node size and color attributes, and finally generates an interactive HTML network graph which opens in a new window.

A2Q INTERACTION - NETWORK ANALYSIS:
For the temporal network analysis, the network graph of A2Q for 1 year, 1 week and 1 day are created.

The code analysis describes the A2Q interaction in a website, where a user answers a specific question asked by another user at a specific time. The exploratory data analysis shows that the number of data points for A2Q was significantly lower than the other two interactions. The reason for this could be the reputation system prevalent on the website. 
The figure for a year shows a bigger and more active network, where some nodes are bigger in size and more densely connected than others. This indicates that a greater number of users are gathered to answer the questions, and the trending or big hit questions can be identified. Centrality measures like Closeness, Betweenness, Degree Centrality, and Eigenvector were also analyzed for A2Q network.

C2A INTERACTION - NETWORK ANALYSIS:
Similar to A2Q, the network is created for C2A interaction. Here, for the temporal analysis we look at the interaction for 1 week and 1 day.

The number of data points for C2A was higher than A2Q but lower than C2Q interactions. The C2A interaction is more popular than A2Q because there is no point system associated with commenting. The analysis shows a one-day network of C2A and a one-week network of C2A, where the nodes with larger sizes mean that more users are commenting on a specific answer, which indicates a trending answer. The analysis also includes the centrality measures for C2A, such as betweenness centrality, degree centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. The findings show that some nodes have a higher centrality score than others, indicating their importance in the network.

C2Q INTERACTION - NETWORK ANALYSIS:
Similar to previous interaction, the network graph is created for C2Q interaction. The analysis was narrowed down to one day due to the large dataset. 

The network graph visualization shows that larger and more densely connected nodes indicate trending questions with more user interest. The centrality metrics were used to analyze the network, and node 1491895 was identified as a significant and influential node. Betweenness had 5,530 nodes with zero betweenness, degree centrality had no edges with zero degree, closeness had 433 unreachable nodes, and Eigen had no nodes with an eigenvalue of zero.

Community Visualization:

Insights and Conclusion:
1. From the network visualization, we can observe that the users have the highest tendency to comment on questions, followed by comment on answer and answer to question.
2. Stack Overflow can enhance the user experience by improving question quality, incentivizing users to answer more questions, and promoting collaboration through forums and chat rooms.
3. By analyzing the weekly trends in traffic, the platform can boost up their site Infrastructure depending on the time.
4. From the network metrics we identified the influential nodes. These nodes can help identify the topics that are widely discussed on the Stack Overflow Platform.
5. From the network metrics and community visualization we can identify influential users and promote them.
